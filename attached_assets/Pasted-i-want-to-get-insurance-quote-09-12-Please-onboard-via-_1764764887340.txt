what is voluntary excess?

09:13

Voluntary excess is the extra amount you choose to pay towards a claim on top of the compulsory excess set by your insurer. By opting for a higher voluntary excess, you might lower your insurance premium, but you'll need to cover more of the costs if you make a claim. It's a way to manage your insurance costs based on your comfort with risk.
