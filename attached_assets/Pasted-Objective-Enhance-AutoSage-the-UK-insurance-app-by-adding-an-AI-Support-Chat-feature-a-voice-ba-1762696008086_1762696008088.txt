Objective:
Enhance AutoSage, the UK insurance app, by adding an AI Support Chat feature — a voice-based assistant that helps customers understand insurance concepts and their own policy details.

Feature to build now:
🗨️ “Chat with AutoSage” Window

Context:

Many UK insurance customers struggle with complex jargons and don’t fully understand their policy documents.

AutoSage should act as a personal AI insurance agent in the user’s pocket — simplifying insurance and making policies easy to understand.

Task Breakdown:

UI Addition:

Under the ‘Search Quotes’ button, add a new AI support icon/button labeled “Chat with AutoSage.”

On Click Behavior:

When the user clicks this button, open a chat dialog box (voice-enabled in future stages).

For now, create a basic chat widget that supports text input/output.

Chat Logic (Phase 1 – Basic):
The chat assistant should:

Greet the user politely.

Answer generic UK insurance jargon or concept questions, e.g.:

“What is voluntary excess?”

“How do I protect my no-claim bonus?”

If the user’s policy document is uploaded:

Answer questions using the content of the document (e.g., “What is my windscreen cover?”).

If no document is uploaded:

Respond:

“I can’t find that information in your documents yet.”

If the question is about:

Quote Search → reply:

“You can find quote search in the Home page.”

Adding Preferences → reply:

“You can add your preferences in the Home → Whisper → Add your preferences for quote search.”

If any other type of question is asked (outside these topics), politely reply:

“Sorry, I can only answer questions related to UK insurance and your policy.”

Development Phases:

Phase 1: Build a simple chat widget (text only).

Phase 2: Implement the UK insurance jargon answering logic (connect with OpenAI).

Phase 3: Integrate policy-document question answering.

Phase 4: Add voice chat capability.

Before you start:

Do you have any questions or clarifications?

Confirm the plan to first build the basic chat UI before connecting AI logic.

✅ Goal for this prompt:
Implement the chat widget (Phase 1), then integrate AI-powered insurance Q&A (Phase 2) as the next step.
