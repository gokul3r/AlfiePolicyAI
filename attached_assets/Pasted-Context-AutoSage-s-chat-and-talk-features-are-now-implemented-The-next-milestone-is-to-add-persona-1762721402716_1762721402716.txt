Context:
AutoSage’s chat and talk features are now implemented.
The next milestone is to add personalization and proactive suggestions to enhance the user experience.

🧩 Feature Name:

Personalization Panel with Notification and Gmail Integration

Objective:

Add a bell (notification icon) and a hamburger menu in the top-right corner of the app UI, introducing basic personalization options and Gmail integration to detect travel plans and suggest travel insurance.

UI Requirements:

Top Bar Additions:

Place a 🔔 Bell icon (notifications) and a ☰ Hamburger menu in the top-right corner of the app header.

Hamburger Menu Behavior:

When clicked, it should display two menu options:

Personalize

Logout

Personalize Option:

Clicking Personalize opens a modal dialog box with the following layout:

Two rows:

Email (label on left) — Toggle switch on the right.

Calendar (label on left) — Toggle switch on the right.

Functional Behavior:
1. Email Toggle:

When the user toggles Email → ON:

Prompt the user to enter their Gmail ID.

Use Google OAuth to connect securely to their Gmail account.

Once connected, automatically:

Read the last 7 days of emails.

Use the AI agent to detect travel-related emails (based on subject or body keywords like ticket, itinerary, booking, flight, journey, travel).

If a travel email is found, extract:

Destination country or city (e.g., “Switzerland”).

Departure date (if available).

Then display a proactive AI message:

“Hey <user_name>, do you want to buy a travel insurance policy for your upcoming trip to <destination>?”

2. Calendar Toggle:

(For future implementation) — Keep inactive for now; just the toggle UI.

3. Logout Option:

Clears all personalization tokens and resets the session.

Development Phases:

Phase 1 – UI Setup:

Add bell and hamburger icons.

Implement menu with Personalize and Logout.

Create the Personalize modal with email & calendar toggles.

Phase 2 – Gmail Connection (Proof of Concept):

Implement Google OAuth flow for Gmail access.

Fetch last 7 days of emails (read-only).

Filter and summarize travel-related emails using AI.

Phase 3 – AI Triggered Personalization:

Generate dynamic suggestions like travel insurance prompts based on extracted info.

Phase 4 – Calendar Integration (Future).

Expected Output Behavior:

When the feature is working:

User clicks hamburger → chooses Personalize.

Toggles Email → ON → enters Gmail → OAuth connects.

AI reads last week’s emails → finds travel info.

App shows a friendly proactive suggestion:

“Hey Gokul, do you want to buy a travel insurance policy for your upcoming trip to Switzerland?”

Before you start:

Do you have any questions about the Gmail integration flow or UI placement?

Confirm that you’ll start with Phase 1 (UI & toggles) before coding Gmail and AI logic.
